# create-vs-code-workspace
Creates a minimal VS Code workspace from a yarn+lerna monorepo.  This code is just for illustrative purposes.  You'll probably need to handcraft it a bit to your own setup.

Usage:
```
create-vs-code-workspace @namespace/project1
create-vs-code-workspace {@namespace/project1,@namespace/project2}
```
